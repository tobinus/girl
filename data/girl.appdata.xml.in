      Girl, the GNOME Internet Radio Locator program, allows users to
      easily find and record live radio programs on radio broadcasters
      on the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Girl is developed for the GNOME desktop and requires one audio
      helper such as Totem to be installed for playback and
      streamripper to be installed for recording live radio streams of
      supported radio stations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enjoy listening to and recording from supported Internet Radio stations in Girl.
