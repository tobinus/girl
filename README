The GIRL program is completely free, but you don't have to do anything
else than run it on your computer with a free operating system in
order to listen to and record from Internet radio stations.  You are
also free to fork it as long as you follow the license terms in GNU
GPL version 2, but I would appreciate if you send patches instead of
releasing your own version.

Send patches through Bugzilla on
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=girl

You could install and run GIRL on free GNU/Linux systems (such as
Debian GNU/Linux available from http://www.debian.org/ and Fedora
Linux available from https://getfedora.org/ with the provided binary
packages) and MacOS X (via macports.org) in order to listen to and
record from the 73 supported Internet radio stations around the world
if you have installed the Videos application
(https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Videos) from the GNOME project.

GIRL 1.0 notes
==============

GIRL is a GNOME Internet Radio Locator program that allows the user to
easily find and record live radio programs on radio broadcasters on
the Internet.

GNOME Internet Radio Locator (GIRL) version 1.0.0 ("Fenchurch") is now
available.  The first major 1.0.0 release is dedicated to the writings
of the English writer, humorist and dramatist Douglas Adams.

GIRL 1.0.0 supports search by location for the 42 supported radio
stations.  42 is Douglas Adams' Answer to Life, the Universe and
Everything in book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Life is
finite.  The Universe is infinite.  Listen to and/or record Everything
that is broadcasted live from 42 radio stations on Earth included with
this program.

GIRL was developed for the GNOME desktop and requires one audio helper
such as Totem (https://developer.gnome.org/totem/) to be installed for
playback and StreamRipper (http://streamripper.sourceforge.net/) to be
installed for recording live radio streams of supported radio stations.

The station list is available in XML from http://girl.software/girl.xml

A user without root on a GNOME desktop can add his or her Favourite
Stations in $HOME/.girl/girl.xml (see src/girl.xml for the syntax).

If a user starts the program and exits the program, then the last radio
station that the user was listening to, appears selected in the Stations
list.  The default girl Stations setting is stored in $HOME/.gnome2/girl

Enjoy Internet Radio.

Cheers,
Ole Aamot <ole@src.gnome.org>
