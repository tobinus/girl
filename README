GIRL 0.9 notes
==============

GIRL is a GNOME Internet Radio Locator program that allows the user
to easily find and record live radio programs on radio broadcasters
on the Internet.

GIRL is developed for the GNOME desktop and requires one audio helper
such as Totem (https://developer.gnome.org/totem/) to be installed for
playback and streamripper (http://streamripper.sourceforge.net/) to be
installed for recording live radio streams of supported radio stations
(http://girl.software/stations.xml)

A user without root on a GNOME desktop can add his or her personal
Stations in $HOME/.girl/stations.xml

If a user starts the program and exits the program, then the last radio
station that the user was listening to, appears selected in the Stations
list.  The default girl Stations setting is stored in $HOME/.gnome2/girl

Enjoy Internet Radio.
