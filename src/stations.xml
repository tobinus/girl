    <description>Coog Radio is an online radio station operated and staffed by students from the University of Houston. Co-founders Conner Clifton, Markley Rogers, and Matt Womack came up with the idea in 2010, but it wasn’t until fall 2011 that the idea finally came to fruition. Coog Radio not only provides a creative outlet for fellow students to express themselves over the air, but also introduces them to the world of broadcasting.</description>

    <description>WVUA-FM is the University’s only student operated radio station. Its history dates back to 1940 when the Department of Radio Arts began operation of an AM carrier-current station (the signal was transmitted to dormitories and other buildings on campus through electrical wiring). The station was known as BRN (the Bama Radio Network). In 1947, the signal was extended and the station became known as WABP. The station was operated as a commercial venture at 570 on the AM dial. During the 1950’s and 1960’s, as more students moved off campus, the station’s listenership dwindled.</description>

    <description>Coimbra University Radio (Portuguese: Rádio Universidade de Coimbra - RUC) is a university radio station of the Coimbra Academic Association (students' union) of the University of Coimbra in Coimbra, Portugal.
    
    It broadcasts on 107.9 FM (also broadcasts on-line). The Center of Experimental Radio was founded in the 40's, but it was only on March, 1st 1986, that the radio obtained the authorization to broadcast on FM.
    
    The studios and offices of this university radio station are located in the main building of the Associação Académica de Coimbra, in the city centre. One of its trademarks is that there are no set playlists for any of the programs broadcast. This allows for an exceptionally wide range of musical genres.
    
    The radio gives courses in Programming, Technic and News, that students from the University of Coimbra can join.
    
    For its 25th anniversary, the radio hosts concerts of the indie Swedish band the Radio Dept., and later Eleanor Friedberger from the rock duo The Fiery Furnaces and the Welsh songwriter Euros Childs.</description>

    <location>Chapel Hill, NC</location>
    <description>WXYC went on the air on March 17, 1977 with Joni Mitchell's "You Turn Me on I'm a Radio."

      WXYC was preceded by WCAR, a carrier current station that reached dorms on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus through electrical wiring. The station's alumni include top 40 radio host Rick Dees.

      When WCAR wanted to upgrade in the early 1970s, it decided to pursue an FM license and begin broadcastin over the air rather than update the carrier current system. Funding for the change to FM was provided by a student referendum passed in 1973. The physical conversion cost $35,000 and took two years to complete.

      The non-profit Student Educational Broadcasting, Inc. was established to serve as the official owner of WXYC's broadcast license, and in 1977 WCAR became WXYC. The station was originally scheduled to begin broadcasting in January 1977, but winter freezes prevented the installation of an antenna on UNC's water tower delaying the broadcast until March.

      From its earliest days in the late 70s, WXYC has been a leader in diverse and interesting programming, adopting changing forms of popular music long before they became popular in the mainstream without losing touch with the past. This coalesced in 1980 with the decision to achieve a delicate balance, avoiding the extremes of both typical commercial (dull, repetitive, narrow) and typical college (difficult, elitist and irritating) radio, by making the effort to find and broadcast the best and brightest of new music that was inexplicably being ignored by commercial radio, while not forgetting the roots of that music in blues, jazz, pop and other types of music of the past half century. At the same time, WXYC became a 24 hour a day/ 365 day a year radio station with a commitment to be consistent in quality and reliable enough to set your clock radio to.WXYC won many accolades and awards during the 80's and 90's from local as well as national sources, including Rolling Stone Magazine, the New York Times and the Independent Weekly.

      In the early 90s, with the advent of the CD, many more international and independent releases became easily available, as well as re-issues of albums that had been impossible to find on vinyl for decades. This enabled WXYC to broaden its programming even more, and to this day the staff of WXYC is committed to seeking out new and interesting sounds from all over the world and presenting them in a coherent, accessible and interesting way.

      In 1994, the staff of UNC's SunSITE, the first Web site in North America, helped WXYC become the first radio station in the world to stream its on-air signal live over the Internet. We're proud to have been at the forefront of the Internet radio medium. We now have loyal listeners all over the world who contact us with comments and requests by email and IM.

      WXYC alumni include ESPN anchor Stuart Scott, former Squirrel Nut Zipper Tom Maxwell, former Polvo guitarist Dave Brylawski, Newsweek reporter Colin Soloway, film director Peyton Reed, as well as scores of doctors, lawyers, writers, executives, and successful professionals of all kinds.</description>
